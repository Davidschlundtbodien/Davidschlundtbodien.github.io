										<h2 class="major">Software Development</h2>
										<p>Creating, designing, and optimizing are some of my biggest passions of which I aim to use every day. Software development streamlines that creativity into productivity and potential career paths. A mix of self-teaching and a 12-week coding Bootcamp called Actualize I strive to expand my knowledge and bolster my development toolkit. I hope to create a foothold in this industry and start a fulfilling career as a developer. </p>

										<h2 class="major">Distribution</h2>
										<p>What started as a hobby in Craft beer while I worked in alcohol retail turned into passion once I started in Distribution. I was lucky to take part in the growth and development of the Craft beer department at Vin Sauvage. While working in both administration and the warehouse I did my best to expand the knowledge as well as the availability of Craft beer. Mainly through assisting to bring rare and artisanal brands to the Las Vegas market, growing our brand and the breweries we brought to the Valley.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Veteran</h2>
										<p>Having been in JROTC for most of High School, I wanted to take the next step and serve my country. Joining the United States Air Force shortly after graduation I enlisted as an Aircraft Electrical & Environmental Specialist. I've served both Active Duty and Reserve performing maintenance on the C-17.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Brewing</h3>
											<p>Homebrewing has been a hobby ever since I was introduced to craft beer. I love the challenge of creating traditional styles as well as the freedom to experiment with any part of the process.  </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/garden.jpg" alt="image of a garden" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Gardening</h3>
											<p>The main reason I garden is to grow my food. Doing so in the desert is a challenge but I welcome it because I find it fulfilling to watch something thrive over time through hard work. Also, gardening plays into one of my strengths being patience.</p>

											<a href="https://www.craftbeer.com/beer/what-is-craft-beer" class="image"><img src="images/craftbeer.jpg" alt="image of beer bottles infront of a barrel" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Craft Beer</h3>
											<p>Over the years this has been a catalyst and driving force for plenty of my passions. The community and culture behind the beer, in general, is unique and often is a common ground for many people regardless of background. I love introducing new people into this world of art and science, collaboration and freedom of expression.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Hiking & Camping</h3>
											<p>We often forget the amount of noise that surrounds us every day in a city. Being outdoors provides that reset and sanctuary from distractions of modern life. I take that time to center my mind while exploring a new trail or setting up camp.</p>

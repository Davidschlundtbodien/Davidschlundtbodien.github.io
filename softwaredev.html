									<h3 class="major">Why Coding?</h3>
									<p>My perception of coding has changed over the years, for a long time I kept my distance due to foolish misconceptions that it was entirely math driven and high-level engineering. Thankfully that changed when I took the plunge into self-teaching with free code camp, delving into languages that sounded familiar, mainly HTML and CSS</p>

									<p> I soon noticed that there is an ever-expanding list of languages, libraries, and frameworks, of which I needed a more directed approach to learning. Thus I joined the Actualize team and after a 12-week Bootcamp, I found my knowledge more robust as well as a strong toolkit to apply towards learning new languages and skills. During my time in the Bootcamp, I realized that I enjoyed creating RESTful APIs and web app front ends utilizing my eye for design, organization, and attention to detail. Now I branching out into Swift and app development that so far I find very rewarding. </p>

									<p>In summary, I chose software development to have an outlet for my creativity, play to my strengths of problem-solving, design and organization, while having the fulfillment of building something for others. Who would say no to the ability to create anything their heart desires? I know I can't, even though my desires are usually to create nerdy apps.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Craft Local</h3>
											<p>A Web App concept designed around helping the independent brewing industry. Focusing on the little guy (Craft beer and Independent Breweries) I decided to create a link between the local community and brewers, thus the name Craft Local. Breweries post new offerings and schedule events while users view breweries based on their vicinity. Each beer has a page breakdown elaborating on the attributes and description of the products. Ideally, this web app will benefit the industry by a streamlined showcase for activities and products a brewery provides.</p>
